<h1>About Me</h1>
<p>Hi. I'm just a simple guy from the countryside.</p>

<p>I'm working in software development business for more than 20 years now in very different projects, seperated all over 
  Germany. Located near to Dresden, Saxony's capital, I'm spending a lot of time here with my family.</p>

<p>I like to play games on my computer. I'm trying to develop my own game, but up to now I didn't manage to find
  the time to progress.
